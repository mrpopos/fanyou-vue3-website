      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>License</h2>
        <p>To use the Service, you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Application. COMPANY does not warrant that the Application will be compatible with your mobile device.

      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Virtual Items</h2>
        <p>From time to time during your use of the Service, you may have the opportunity to “earn”, “buy” or “purchase” (a) virtual in-game items; or (b) virtual in-game points, including but not limited to virtual coins, cash or points, all for use in the Service (together with virtual in-game items, “Virtual Items”). You do not in fact “own” the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real points or its equivalent. Rather, by “earning”, “buying” or “purchasing” Virtual Items, you are granted a limited license to use the software programs that manifest themselves as the Virtual Items. The purchase and sale of such limited licenses to use Virtual Items is a completed transaction upon redemption of the applicable payment and shall under no circumstances be refundable, transferable or exchangeable including, without limitation, upon termination of your Account, termination of these Terms, and/or the discontinuation of the Service. </p>
        <p>COMPANY prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of Virtual Items effectuated outside of the Service, or the purported sale, gift or trade of anything that appears or originates in the Service, unless otherwise expressly authorized by COMPANY in writing. Accordingly, you may not sublicense, trade, sell or attempt to sell in-game Virtual Items for real money, or exchange Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of a game, without COMPANY’s written permission. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and will subject your Account to termination. You acknowledge and agree: (a) that COMPANY may change the price of Virtual Items at any time, without notice, for any reason or for no reason, (b) that the amount of virtual points necessary to obtain certain Virtual Items may fluctuate, and (c) that COMPANY has no liability to you for any changes in the price of such Virtual Items and/or the amount of virtual points necessary to obtain Virtual Items. COMPANY reserves the right, without prior notification, to limit the quantity of the Virtual Items you can purchase and/or to refuse to allow you to purchase such Virtual Items. You acknowledge and agree that COMPANY shall have no liability for loss of Virtual Items due to any unauthorized third party activity, such as hacking, phishing, password mining, social engineering, and/or any other unauthorized third party activity. COMPANY may replace such lost Virtual Items at its sole discretion on a case-by-case basis, without incurring any further obligation or liability. COMPANY owns, has licensed, or otherwise has rights to use all of the content that appears on or in the Service. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, you agree that you have no right or title in or to any content that appears in the Service, including without limitation the Virtual Items therein, whether “earned” in a game or “purchased” from COMPANY.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Loyalty Points</h2>
        <p>You may have the opportunity to accumulate “Loyalty Points” through your use of the Service. Loyalty Points are virtual in-game points that you can use to “purchase” other Virtual Items within the Service. As with all Virtual Items, you do not in fact own the Loyalty Points you accumulate and the amounts of any Loyalty Points you accumulate do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, by “earning”, “buying”, or “purchasing” Loyalty Points, you are merely granted a limited license to use the software programs that manifest themselves as the Loyalty Points. In the event COMPANY encounters issues with the game that impact the accumulation of Loyalty Points and/or the redemption of Rewards, COMPANY reserves the right to correct any such errors.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Accumulating Loyalty Points</h2>
        <p>You may accumulate Loyalty Points by taking certain actions while using the Service. For example, you may earn Loyalty Points by posting your in-game achievements to your social media account, “liking” certain aspects of the Service, playing the games for a specified duration, or participating in certain in-game offers. The foregoing list is solely for purposes of example and explanation and is not meant to be exclusive or exhaustive. Loyalty Points are NOT and WILL NOT be awarded or earned in any way related to or based upon the outcome of any game you play during your use of the Service.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Using Loyalty Points</h2>
        <p>You may exchange your accumulated Loyalty Points for in-game Virtual Items in the Service. You may also exchange your Loyalty Points for Rewards in the “Rewards” area of the Service. In order to redeem a Reward, you must have a valid account connected with the Application. The first time you exchange your Loyalty Points for Rewards, you will be asked to provide your name and e-mail address. The name you provide must match the name that appears on a government-issued identification belonging to the person who has accumulated the Loyalty Points through his/her use of the Service.</p>
        <p>Once you have exchanged Loyalty Points for a Reward, you are said to have “purchased” that Reward. After purchasing your Reward, you will have a limited period of time in which complete a “redemption process” by following a defined “redemption method.” Redeeming a reward that has been purchased in the Service secures that reward for your specific use at a particular time. When the redemption process is complete, you may then “use” the reward. A Reward is considered “used” at the moment when it is consumed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Inactive Accounts</h2>
        <p>If you do not use your Account by logging in using the Service at least once every 30 days, your Account will be deemed inactive. You can, at any time, reactivate your Account by logging in and using the Service. When an Account has been deemed inactive, COMPANY may, at its own discretion, expire any Loyalty Points accumulated by you. Once your account is deemed inactive, any Rewards which have been purchased but not yet redeemed may also be expired at the discretion of COMPANY.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Third Party Providers of Goods and Service</h2>
        <p>Our Partners reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to change, amend, suspend, cancel, or terminate any program they offer or any aspects and/or terms and conditions thereof, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice and for any or no reason. You hereby agree that COMPANY shall have no liability to you as a result of such action by a Partner.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>COMPANY may terminate or suspend your Account (including, but not limited to, suspending your ability to purchase, redeem or consume Rewards) and/or your access to Service (including, but not limited to, restricting your ability to use the Application) at any time, including for breach of these Terms or otherwise, without notice and without liability to you. Upon any such termination, your access to the Service, including all User Content (as defined below) and Virtual Items, will be disabled and you will lose any Loyalty Points that you have accumulated.

        <h2>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
        <p>If you live in the United States or another jurisdiction that allows you to agree to arbitration, you and COMPANY agree that all Disputes, as defined below, between you and COMPANY will be settled by binding arbitration, unless otherwise provided herein.</p>
        <p>This agreement does not apply (1) if you are a resident of any jurisdiction which prohibits this arbitration agreement, (2) if you opt out of this arbitration agreement as described in section (e) below, or (3) to certain types of Disputes described in section (e) below. Please read this provision carefully.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provision (“Provision”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and COMPANY.</p>
        <p>Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. In the absence of an arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in court, before a judge or jury, and/or participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. </p>
        <p>Except as otherwise provided herein, by agreeing to these Terms, you waive your right to litigate claims in court and waive the right to have your claims heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys’ fees).</p>
        <p>You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.</p>
        <p>For the purpose of these Terms, including this Provision specifically, “COMPANY” means Flora Fun Games Pvt Ltd.,  “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and COMPANY regarding any aspect of your relationship with COMPANY, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.</p>

        <p>YOU AND COMPANY EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION, AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
        <p>you understand and agree that by entering into this agreement you and COMPANY are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and COMPANY might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <p>Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and COMPANY specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of this Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of the Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h2>
        <p>For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give COMPANY an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by written notification to: </p>
        <p>for all United States users: Flora Fun Games Pvt Ltd, 234, TOWER B-2, SPAZE IT PARK, SOHNA ROAD, SECTOR 49, Gurgaon, Haryana, 122018.</p>
        <p>For all other users: Flora Fun Games Pvt Ltd, 234, TOWER B-2, SPAZE IT PARK, SOHNA ROAD, SECTOR 49, Gurgaon, Haryana, 122018.</p>
        <p>That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If COMPANY does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</h2>
        <p>Notwithstanding the above, you or COMPANY may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (i) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (ii) YOU PROVIDE THE COMPANY WRITTEN NOTICE OF YOUR DESIRE TO OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Arbitration Opt-Out Notice”). To opt-out of these arbitration procedures, you must provide written notification to:</p>
        <p>For all United States users: Flora Fun Games Pvt Ltd, 234, TOWER B-2, SPAZE IT PARK, SOHNA ROAD, SECTOR 49, Gurgaon, Haryana, 122018.</p>
        <p>For all other users: Flora Fun Games Pvt Ltd, 234, TOWER B-2, SPAZE IT PARK, SOHNA ROAD, SECTOR 49, Gurgaon, Haryana, 122018.</p>
        <p>Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with COMPANY through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with COMPANY. If you do not provide the Company with an Arbitration Opt-Out Notice within 30 days from the date that you first consent to these Terms, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above.</p>
        <p>Additionally, notwithstanding the above, COMPANY reserves the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction against you to stop and/or seek compensation for the intentional or willful misuse or abuse (e.g. hacking or falsifying location) of its intellectual property, services, and products.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Arbitration Procedures – United States Users</h2>
        <p>If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (“Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution”) either you or COMPANY may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration. Unless both you and the Company agree in writing, the arbitrator shall not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this Provision, as well as any dispute related to its interpretation, applicability, or formation, including any claim that all or any part of it is void or voidable. For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules for Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. Because the Service and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Arbitration Award</h2>
        <p>The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Location of Arbitration</h2>
        <p>For Disputes between the COMPANY and users who are residents of the United States, you or COMPANY may initiate arbitration in either San Francisco, California or the federal judicial district that includes the address you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution. In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes the address you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution, COMPANY may transfer the arbitration to San Francisco, California in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</h2>
        <p>Each Party shall pay its own arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses. You are responsible for all fees and costs that You incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Arbitration Procedures – Users Outside the United States</h2>
        <p>For Disputes between the COMPANY and users who are not residents of the United States that are not resolved through the Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution procedures set forth above, either you or COMPANY may initiate arbitration by submitting the Dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”) for arbitration. Such arbitration shall be conducted exclusively in Hong Kong, at HKIAC, in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of applying for arbitration. The appointing authority shall be HKIAC. The language to be used in the arbitral preceding shall be English. In such arbitration before HKIAC, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of Hong Kong, regardless of choice of laws or conflicts of laws.</p>
        <p>The arbitral award is final and binding upon both parties and the award shall be rendered in the English language pursuant to the laws of Hong Kong. No demand for arbitration may be made after the date when the institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claim or dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-content">
